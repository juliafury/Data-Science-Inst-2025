# Introduction

## Our Research Question and the ANES 2016 Pilot Study

- The ANES 2016 Pilot Study surveyed 1200 respondents on a wide range of topics.
- Responses were collected online from January 22th, 2016 through January 28th, 2016 by the American National Election Studies (ANES).
- Our research question investigates the relationships between survey respondents' positions on certain social/political topics and their reported candidates of choice in the 2016 Presidential election.

## Variables We Examined

The central variable in our analysis was the respondents' candidates of choice for the 2016 Presidential election. Respondents' answers to this question were analyzed alongside the four other variables we tracked:
- Perception of the economy at the time of the survey compared to a year prior
- Opinion about the federal government's role in addressing climate change
- Perception of racial advantage or disadvantage held by white people
- Opinion on immigration numbers
While there were many variables related to respondents' economic, environmental, racial, and immigration-related positions, we chose to graph one variable from each category that seemed the most representative.
